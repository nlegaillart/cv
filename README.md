Here is my french resume in json-fresh and json-jrs formats.

To generate other formats you will need:
 * [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
 * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
 * [HackMyResume](https://github.com/hacksalot/HackMyResume)
 * [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (for Microsoft formats; I don't know exactly why HackMyResume cannot do this...)
 * [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) if you do not want to build by hand

*Important*: On the first use run "make install" to install required Node modules in theme directory.

Included jsonresume theme is a modified Version of [Curzy theme](https://github.com/Curzy/jsonresume-theme-curzy) which is a modified version of Stack Overflow theme for jsonresume ([jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow](https://github.com/francescoes/jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow))
