Here is my resume in json-fresh and json-jrs formats.

To generate other formats you will need:
 * [HackMyResume](https://github.com/hacksalot/HackMyResume)
 * [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (for doc and docx formats; I don't know exactly why HackMyResume cannot do this...)
 * [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) if you do not want to build by hand

Included jsonresume theme is a modified Version of [Curzy theme](https://github.com/Curzy/jsonresume-theme-curzy) wich is a mdified version of Stack Overflow theme for jsonresume ([jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow](https://github.com/francescoes/jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow))
